// GENERATED TEST — `zfa tdd gen A3` (spec 044-test-tdd-generation).
//
// behavior_id: A3
// source_criterion: AC-3
// kind: acceptance
// description: the Rust native library is linked into the app by the iOS adapter package's own Swift package, exactly as the macOS adapter does.
//
// This test asserts the observable behavior described above. It is
// "honest red" on first execution: the paired subject at
// `package:html_to_markdown_ffi_workspace/tdd/001-zero-touch-native-distribution/a3_subject.dart` is unimplemented, so the test fails through an
// assertion (not an uncaught error, compile/load error, skip, or
// placeholder). Replace the subject's
// stub body with real implementation to make this test pass.
// zfa:tdd: A3:hand — hand step completed before first red certification (issue #1411)
